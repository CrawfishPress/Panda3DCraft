# Panda3DCraft
A clone of Minecraft made in Panda3D. Very early WIP.


**CONTROLS:**

* Use the mouse to move the camera (this is temporary)
* Left click to delete blocks
* Right click to place blocks
* ESC to pause
* 1-9 to select a block

## WARNING
The bundled version of noise is compiled for 32-bit Python. If you're using the 64-bit Panda3D, you'll have to build it yourself.
